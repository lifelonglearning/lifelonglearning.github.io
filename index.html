	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	<h3>My name is Gregory Kinsella Hartwich</h3>
	<p><b><i>This is a paragraph. It's not important what the paragraph says, I just put this here to take up space. I didn't think anyone would read these words, so I didn't put a lot of thought into what I was saying. My name's not William Shakespeare, so you're not reading a sonnet. Yes, just a stream of consciousness rant that I decided to type into "Sublime" You're still here? Very persistent! Don't you have better things to do besides read this boring block of text? Or is your life really so dull that this is exciting to you? Go away! Stop reading this! You could be breathing in some fresh air outdoors, exercising, painting a picture, etc. But you're not, you're cooped up inside staring at your computer screen!<i></b></p>
